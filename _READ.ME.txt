About the DmL-ES:

 Way back in 1999, DmL Presents (then known mostly as DmL Corp.) released a home
video console known as the DmL-ES, a 10-bit 68k CPU at 10Mhz able to address
expansion processors. It went on to achieve modest critical success, and had
many imitators. It ended up as a niche hobbyist machine, since it required a
special TV capable of displaying the DmL-ES's uncommon screen resolution of
960x532 (x540 in PAL regions), but was a leader for the push toward HD tele-
vision tech and its creators were part of the standards body which eventually
created HDTV.

 The most common expansion processor was the 16-bit 20Mhz RISC processor later
known as the DmLFX (Digital math Legion and eFfects Xomparator), which was 
developed by Jet Labs.

 It had five hardware screen planes up to 8160 pixels, 48 colors per layer,
could display 192 sprites (64 per line) of up to 96x96 pixels.  It had many
special color modes, including primitive color mixing in RGB334.
 
 It had a 9 channel ADPCM in 32kHz 16-bit surround.

 Today, we are releasing our in-house emulator with the first of several of our
most popular branded games included.
