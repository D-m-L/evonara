--Overarching goals
	- parody/shout-out a ton of games/movies/genres/pop-culture/authors/designers/musicians
	- real pathos
		(at the end of LttP - the boy who was too sick to play gets outside! etc)
	- something that seems VERY lighthearted turns out to have a ton of depth
		(pilotwings, for instance, blindsides you with military mission)
	- tie in comic games/locations/characters, wispa locations/characters
	- items & weapons
	- player progression
	- 2 player?? (network, or?)

Questions I want to answer:

Is it possible to get some real pathos?

Let's posit a cast of characters, many of whom are in bad shape: sad, sick, dying, some who die in the course of the game.

Let's posit characters who are not strong enough to face reality, do we make them face it, or save them from it?

Let's posit a way to fix everything for everybody.  In which cases would it go against their free will?
